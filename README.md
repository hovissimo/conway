A quick demo of Conway's Game of Life using Python.
This demo is intentionally kept simple for accesibility and demonstration.

This demo uses the curses library.
- Windows users can get an installer here: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
- Other users should have curses installed already.
